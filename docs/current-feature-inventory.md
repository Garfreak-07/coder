## API Surface

Current frontend product calls use `/api/v3/*` endpoints. The React code no
longer contains runtime switching to a removed v2 backend.

Primary Rust API groups:

- health, capabilities, and role cards
- workflow validation, default workflow, and workflow library storage
- Planner Chat sessions, turns, plan state, readiness, and explicit Start Work
- run preview, start, list, detail, events, controls, reports, artifacts,
  checkpoints, blobs, and repo evidence
- repo, command, patch, memory, knowledge, MCP, extensions, skills, and provider
  settings endpoints

## Historical Note

The previous Python/FastAPI v2 compatibility implementation was removed from
current `main`. It remains available in git history at tag
`pre-rust-only-legacy-v2`.

Current `main` does not maintain a Python/FastAPI v2 package, CI job, or
frontend API selector.

## Mock And Development Surfaces

`/api/v3/runs/mock`, `NativeMockBackend`, and the local mock MCP operations are
kept for deterministic CI, smoke tests, and development. They are not the
ordinary product execution path. `/api/v3/runs` uses `WorkflowRunner`.
