# Current Feature Inventory

This document is the Phase 0 no-regression baseline for the Rust-first rebuild.
It inventories current user-visible features and important internal subsystems
before any future deletion or quarantine of Python code.

Classification values:

- `KEEP_AS_USER_FEATURE`: keep the behavior and user concept.
- `REPLACE_WITH_RUST_CORE`: preserve behavior through Rust control-plane code.
- `MOVE_TO_OPENHANDS_BACKEND`: preserve behavior through the OpenHands adapter.
- `MOVE_TO_PLUGIN_OR_LATER_PHASE`: preserve the public shape, implement later.
- `DELETE_INTERNAL_CONCEPT_ONLY`: remove/rename only after behavior is mapped.
- `UNKNOWN_NEEDS_INVESTIGATION`: do not delete until product impact is known.

## Required Phase 0 Conclusions

- No current user-visible feature is approved for deletion.
- OpenHands-backed harness behavior is explicitly preserved and migrates through
  an external OpenHands backend adapter.
- The workflow canvas remains a normal user feature and migrates to stable
  Agent/Harness/Workflow specs.
- Python runtime code remains available until Rust parity is proven.
- Internal names such as `AgentGraphRunner`, `HarnessRuntimeManager`,
  `SharedRunState`, `ContextPacket`, and `ArtifactProjector` are migration
  implementation details, not future user-facing concepts.

## Existing API Groups

- Health and capabilities: `/api/v2/health`, `/api/v2/capabilities`,
  `/api/v2/agent-role-cards`.
- Library and workflow editing: `/api/v2/library`,
  `/api/v2/library/agents`, `/api/v2/library/agent-workflows`,
  `/api/v2/agent-workflows/default`, `/api/v2/agent-workflows/validate`,
  `/api/v2/agent-workflows/runtime-profiles`.
- Planner Chat: `/api/v2/planner-chat/draft`,
  `/api/v2/planner-chat/confirm`, `/api/v2/planner-chat/sessions`,
  `/api/v2/planner-chat/sessions/{session_id}/turn`.
- Runs: `/api/v2/live-agent-runs`, `/api/v2/runs`,
  `/api/v2/runs/{run_id}/events`, pause/resume/cancel/heartbeat, artifact,
  context-packet, tool-result, and blob retrieval.
- Memory/RAG: `/api/v2/knowledge-sources/import-text`,
  `/api/v2/knowledge-sources`, `/api/v2/rag/reindex`,
  `/api/v2/rag/status`.
- Extensions/skills: `/api/v2/extensions/*`, `/api/v2/skills/*`.
- Patches: `/api/v2/patches/rollback`.

## Missing Rust Tests To Add Next

- `coder-config`: parse `.coder/coder.yaml` including agents, harnesses, and
  workflows.
- `coder-store`: event sequence ordering, replay, artifact traversal denial,
  blob hash stability and retrieval, large payload preview/ref behavior, and
  sanitized repo evidence refs under `runs/{run_id}/repo_evidence/`.
- `coder-workflow`: mock runner completed/blocked/failed/max-rounds cases.
- `coder-openhands`: unavailable server, auth failure, raw event
  normalization, redacted secrets.
- `coder-server`: `/api/v3` health, config validation, workflow validation,
  mock run, run listing, event listing, stored artifact/blob retrieval, and
  stored repo evidence payload retrieval by ref.
- `coder-memory`: project memory file loading, bounded memory write previews,
  and content-free memory read events.
- `coder-tools`: path-safe read-only repo file discovery, full-file reads,
  bounded line-range reads, bounded text search, read-only git status evidence,
  and bounded git diff previews. The first Rust slice skips runtime/vendor
  directories and sensitive repo paths. The CLI can optionally record
  find/read-range/search/diff outputs into `coder-store` repo evidence refs.
- Frontend adapter: legacy canvas to `WorkflowSpec` and back.
