| `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\smoke-rust-v3.ps1 -Store .tmp\smoke-rust-v3` | Passed | Returned `status: ok`, `validation: plumbing`, `provider_test: mock`, 4 turns, completed run, 37 timeline items, completed report, 1 review changeset, and `undo_status: undone`. |
| `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1 -DryRun` | Passed | Windows target resolved to `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`; no download/install performed. |

### OpenHands Live Smoke Notes

The successful live smoke used the current OpenHands Agent Server API shape:

- conversation payload includes `workspace.kind=LocalWorkspace` and local `working_dir`
- agent payload uses `kind=Agent`
- tools are mapped to Agent Canvas names: `terminal`, `file_editor`, `task_tracker`
- OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek credentials are injected through the OpenHands agent `llm` payload from environment variables and are not written to Coder metadata
- Planner Chat live DeepSeek requests disable provider thinking and set a bounded `max_tokens` value so longer non-English answers remain usable through the provider/proxy path
- OpenHands finish-tool events are recognized as `executor.completed`
- the smoke workflow is single-round so `executor.completed` ends the run instead of starting a second executor pass
- event polling uses `max_events: 100`; `limit=200` was observed to trigger HTTP 500 on this local OpenHands server
- the full path smoke drives Planner Chat in `work` mode, then starts the configured workflow and verifies Timeline, Review Changes, Undo, and secret redaction from the Coder API surface

## npm Audit Note

`npm.cmd ci` reported `1 low severity vulnerability` and suggested
`npm audit fix`. This did not block frontend tests or build.

## Known Blockers

No required local validation blocker remains after the clippy cleanup and npm
file-lock retry.

Known non-blocking items remain tracked in `docs/NON_BLOCKING_ENHANCEMENTS.md`.
