# Rust Migration Map

This document maps current Python/React subsystems to Rust-first equivalents.
It complements `docs/current-feature-inventory.md` and defines deletion gates:
no Python subsystem may be removed or moved to `legacy-python/` until its user
behavior is covered by a Rust equivalent and tests listed here.

## Migration Phases

| Phase | Goal | Must not do |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | Freeze current capabilities and mappings | Delete Python, remove UI features, rewrite frontend, change license |
| Phase 1 | Stabilize Rust workspace and specs | Replace current product path |
| Phase 2 | Add event log/blob store parity | Store secrets or large payloads inline |
| Phase 3 | Add mock workflow runner | Depend on OpenHands availability |
| Phase 4 | Add OpenHands backend spike | Embed Python SDK in Rust |
| Phase 5 | Add Rust API v3 and frontend adapter | Remove v2 endpoints prematurely |
| Phase 6 | Migrate real workflows behind flags | Drop Python fallback before parity |
| Phase 7 | Quarantine/delete legacy internals | Remove any user-visible behavior silently |
| Separate | MIT license migration after ownership confirmation | Combine license churn with runtime rewrites |

## Subsystem Mapping

| Current subsystem | Current files | Rust target | Migration action | Deletion gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Planner Chat sessions | `server/planner_chat_sessions.py`, `server/app.py`, planner chat frontend | `coder-core` run/session types, `coder-server` API, `coder-agent` prompt rendering | Add Rust session DTOs and readiness gate, then adapter endpoint | Discuss/work behavior has parity tests and UI uses Rust API |
| Legacy draft/confirm | `planner-chat/draft`, `planner-chat/confirm` | Rust run preview and confirmation gate | Keep compatibility until Rust preview supports edits/approval | Existing frontend no longer depends on legacy draft payloads |
| Agent workflow model | `core/agent_workflow.py`, `frontend/src/types.ts` | `coder-config::AgentSpec`, `HarnessSpec`, `WorkflowSpec`, UI protocol DTOs | Add adapters between legacy JSON and specs | Roundtrip preserves layout, max rounds, agents, harness bindings |
| Workflow canvas | `frontend/src/features/agent-workflow`, `workflowGraph.ts` | Frontend adapter plus Rust validation API | Validate spec through Rust when available, keep current UI simple | Browser/UI tests prove save/import/export parity |
| Agent role cards | `core/archetypes.py` | Agent templates in `coder-config`/`coder-agent` | Generate role catalog from stable specs | UI no longer needs Python role card endpoint |
| Harness profiles | `harness_runtime/profiles.py`, `contracts.py` | `coder-harness` and `HarnessSpec` | Translate current profile IDs into user-facing work modes | All canonical profiles map to HarnessSpec examples/tests |
| Runtime provider selection | `HarnessRuntimeManager` | Backend registry | Keep manager until Rust registry dispatches mock/native/OpenHands | Rust dispatch covers OpenHands enabled/unavailable/fallback cases |
| OpenHands provider | `openhands_provider.py`, `openhands_tools` | `coder-openhands` | Implement external Agent Server health, send, stream, normalize | Real or simulated OpenHands events stored as Coder JSONL |
| Internal fallback | `fallback_provider.py` | Mock/native Rust backend | Implement mock workflow runner and later native tools | Python fallback unused by default and tests pass on Rust mock/native |
| ActionGateway/tool execution | `actions/*` | `coder-tools`, `coder-sandbox`, Rust tool gateway | Port action policy and side-effect eventing | Patch/command/plugin/MCP policy tests pass in Rust |
| Patch pipeline | `coding/patch_*` | Rust patch tool with artifact refs | Start with preview/apply under sandbox policy | Rollback and scope safety tests pass |
| Command checks | `coding/command_*` | Rust command runner | Add allow/ask/deny, timeout, stdout/stderr blobs | Command tests pass and approval events emitted |
| Event model | `agent_graph/events.py`, run events stores | `coder-events` | Promote canonical JSONL event envelope with sequence IDs | Replay/listing tests cover current live/stored events |
| Run storage | `server/storage.py`, `server/stores/*` | `coder-store` | Expand metadata/events/artifacts/blobs/checkpoints | Stored run API reads Rust-created runs |
| Blob/artifact stores | `core/artifacts.py`, stores | `coder-store` | Add content hash refs and traversal-safe reads | Large payload and secret redaction tests pass |
| Final reports | `agent_graph/final_report.py` | `coder-core::FinalReport` plus report builder | Build reports from events, not model claims | Completed/blocked/failed/cancelled report tests pass |
| Runtime state views | `runtime_state/*` | Event replay plus UI projections | Replace internal cache exposure with bounded DTOs | UI/debug exports have equivalent data |
| Context packets | `context/*`, context stores | Rust context assembler | Preserve hot/warm/cold behavior behind public refs | Token/large-payload tests pass |
| Repo evidence tools | `context/repo_*`, Git inspection helpers | `coder-tools` repo search/read/status/diff/find plus `coder-store` repo evidence refs | Port path safety, sensitive-path filtering, bounded line-range reads, bounded previews, and evidence write behavior; wire CLI tools to optional repo evidence recording | Existing repo_search/read/discovery/status/diff and evidence-store tests have Rust equivalents |
| Agentic router | `context/agentic_router.py` | Later Rust context router | Defer until repo tools and memory are stable | Router policy tests pass in Rust |
| Memory service | `memory/service.py`, `run_memory.py` | `coder-memory` | Model scopes, records, cards, proposals, events | Long-term writes are confirmed and executor cannot write directly |
| Knowledge import/RAG | `memory/knowledge_import.py`, `hybrid_*` | `coder-memory`, `coder-rag` | Port lexical retrieval first, dense optional later | ACL and hint-only behavior covered |
| Extensions/plugins | `extensions/*` | Rust plugin registry | Preserve API shape, port manifest validation | External-effect approval and manifest tests pass |
| Skills | `skills/*` | Rust skill store/router | Preserve discover/install/update/pin/rollback | Skill lifecycle tests pass |
| MCP | `tools/mcp.py`, registries | Rust MCP registry/server/client | Keep deny-by-default, expose later | Manifest validation and no-auto-enable tests pass |
| Provider settings | `server/settings.py`, frontend settings | `coder-model` profiles and Rust settings API | Keep secret refs only, redact values | Provider status/test behavior has Rust parity |
| Python CLI | `cli.py` | `coder-cli` | Add Rust commands while keeping Python CLI | Rust CLI can run mock and OpenHands spike workflows |
| FastAPI server | `server/app.py` | `coder-server` Axum API v3 | Add v3 endpoints; preserve v2 until frontend migrates | Frontend can run against Rust server for main flow |
| React app | `frontend/src` | Same app with Rust API adapter | Avoid rewrite; add adapter layer | Main pages validated through browser smoke |
| Tests | `tests/`, frontend build, future Cargo tests | Multi-language CI gates | Keep Python tests until parity tests replace them | Equivalent Rust/frontend tests exist before deleting Python tests |

## Stable Public Protocol Targets

| Protocol area | First Rust shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Specs | YAML/JSON `AgentSpec`, `HarnessSpec`, `WorkflowSpec` | Human-editable, versioned |
| Events | JSONL with event id, run id, sequence, timestamp, kind, payload, refs | Large payloads by artifact/blob ref |
| API | `/api/v3/*` JSON and SSE/WebSocket event stream | Keep v2 until frontend migration |
| Debug export | JSON/JSONL/Markdown | No binary-only format |
| Blobs | raw bytes by content hash | Used for logs, diffs, screenshots, long text |

## OpenHands Migration Gates

OpenHands support is considered preserved only when Rust can:

1. Read external server config.
2. Health-check the OpenHands Agent Server.
3. Surface server unavailable/auth/workspace errors clearly.
4. Send a user task or attach to an existing conversation where supported.
5. Stream or fetch OpenHands events.
6. Normalize events into Coder JSONL.
7. Preserve raw event refs for debug export.
8. Keep secrets out of events and artifacts.

Until then, current Python OpenHands paths remain available.

## Canvas Migration Gates

The workflow canvas can move to Rust-backed specs only when:

1. Existing Planner -> Executor graph imports into `WorkflowSpec`.
2. Exported `WorkflowSpec` imports back without losing positions or max rounds.
3. Save As collision behavior is preserved.
4. Runtime internals remain hidden from ordinary UI.
5. Validation errors are shown in user-facing terms.

## Deletion Rules

- Delete internal concepts only, not capabilities.
- Do not delete Python code in the same change that introduces an unproven Rust
  equivalent.
- Do not remove OpenHands, canvas, custom agents/workflows/harnesses, memory,
  evidence, or run control.
- If a subsystem is ambiguous, mark it `UNKNOWN_NEEDS_INVESTIGATION` and keep it.
