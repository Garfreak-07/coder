# Plugin And Skills Page

The React Plugins & Skills page is deferred from the core Planner/Executor
product path. It is not shown in the main sidebar by default; the existing
React page is only reachable through the developer debug UI while the core loop
is the release focus: `Planner Chat -> Start Work -> Timeline -> Review`.

Developer debug UI is enabled only with `?debug=1` or
`localStorage.coder_debug_ui=1`.

Release rule: the ordinary product sidebar must not render `Plugins & Skills`.
Only the debug-gated `showExtensions` path may expose it, and the core release
claim must stay focused on Planner Chat, Start Work, Timeline, Review, and
Settings.

Backend surfaces remain available as non-core experimental/developer APIs for
local skill and plugin validation, harness loading, and future Codex-inspired
plugin work:

```text
GET  /api/v3/plugins/marketplaces
POST /api/v3/plugins/marketplaces
DELETE /api/v3/plugins/marketplaces/{name}
POST /api/v3/plugins/marketplaces/{name}/upgrade

GET /api/v3/plugins
GET /api/v3/plugins/installed
GET /api/v3/plugins/{plugin_id}
GET /api/v3/plugins/{plugin_id}/skills/{skill_name}

GET  /api/v3/skills/extra-roots
POST /api/v3/skills/extra-roots
GET  /api/v3/hooks
```
