# Review And Undo

Review Changes is exposed through:

```text
GET  /api/v3/runs/{run_id}/changes
GET  /api/v3/runs/{run_id}/changes/{change_set_id}/diff
POST /api/v3/runs/{run_id}/changes/{change_set_id}/accept
POST /api/v3/runs/{run_id}/changes/{change_set_id}/undo
```

The list endpoint contract is:

```json
{
  "run_id": "run-id",
  "changes": []
}
```

`changes` is always an array. Runs with no reviewable diff return an empty
array, not `null`, and normal responses do not include alternate names such as
`change_sets` or raw backend payload JSON.

The current baseline builds a conservative changeset from the run's repo root,
final report, and current git diff. Opening the review records that diff in a
run artifact. Review Changes is hidden when a run has no actual changes.

Undo policy:

- Undo uses `git apply -R`.
- Undo first checks the reverse patch with `git apply -R --check`.
- Undo proceeds only if the current working-tree diff exactly matches the
  recorded review diff.
- If the diff changed after review, the endpoint returns `409 Conflict`.
- Conflict responses include a file-level summary of what changed between the
  recorded review diff and the current working-tree diff.
- Coder never silently discards unrelated user changes.

Binary and untracked file handling:

- Binary changes are treated as reviewable only when they appear in `git diff`.
  The review summary records the file path, but the ordinary diff preview may
  not contain text hunks.
- Untracked files are not undone by Review/Undo unless they are represented in
  the recorded diff. Undo never runs `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, or any
  equivalent broad discard operation.
- If a user edits, adds, removes, or otherwise changes files after the review
  diff is recorded, Undo refuses and keeps the current working tree intact.

Frontend rendering lives in:

```text
frontend/src/features/review-changes/ReviewChangesCard.tsx
frontend/src/features/review-changes/changeSetTypes.ts
```

Future work can add run-start snapshots and checkpoint restore fallback, but
the current implementation already provides explicit diff review, accept, and
safe reverse-patch undo.

Review/undo is part of the explicit Start Work path. Planner Chat remains
side-effect free; chat turns never create reviewable changes. Accept records
user approval of a changeset and does not remove timeline or evidence records.
