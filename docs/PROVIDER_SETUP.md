# Provider Setup

Normal users configure model access in the app UI:

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Click `DeepSeek preset`, or choose:
   - provider: `openai-compatible`
   - base URL: `https://api.deepseek.com`
   - model: `deepseek-v4-flash`
3. Paste the provider API key into `API Key`.
4. Click `Save`.
5. Click `Test Provider`.

`deepseek-v4-pro` is also supported when the account has access to that model.

API keys are accepted by the Rust server and kept in server memory for this MVP.
The settings response only returns whether a key is configured and where it came
from. Plaintext keys must not be written into repository files, run events,
timeline items, evidence blobs, reports, debug exports, or screenshots.

TODO: replace the in-memory key store with an OS keychain or local secret store
before public desktop release.

## Developer Fallback

Environment variables remain for CI, smoke tests, and headless development:

```powershell
$env:LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.deepseek.com"
$env:LLM_API_KEY="..."
$env:LLM_MODEL="deepseek-v4-flash"
```

Provider-specific variables such as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or
`CODER_API_KEY` may also be used by developer tooling. They are fallback paths,
not the normal user setup path.

## Optional Live LLM Smoke

Mock tests prove CI-safe plumbing. The live smoke proves the product Planner
path can call a real OpenAI-compatible provider without making CI depend on
paid credentials:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\live-llm-smoke.ps1 -SkipIfMissingProvider
```

The script starts a temporary Rust API v3 server, configures Provider Settings
in server memory, sends two Planner Chat turns, verifies chat turns do not
start execution, and calls Start Work. It returns `skipped` when no provider key
is available and `-SkipIfMissingProvider` is set.

For DeepSeek, set one of these first:

```powershell
$env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="..."
# or
$env:LLM_API_KEY="..."
```

The key is passed only through the current process environment or in-memory
provider settings for the temporary server. The script does not write plaintext
keys to repository files or print them.

For OpenAI or another OpenAI-compatible service, pass the provider, base URL,
model, and key env name explicitly:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\live-llm-smoke.ps1 `
  -Provider openai `
  -BaseUrl https://api.openai.com/v1 `
  -Model gpt-5.5 `
  -ApiKeyEnv OPENAI_API_KEY
```
