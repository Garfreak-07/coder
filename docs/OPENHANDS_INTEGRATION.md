# OpenHands Integration

OpenHands is the preferred backend for full executor tool loops when an
OpenHands harness is configured. Coder owns the workflow boundary around that
backend:

- build the OpenHands conversation payload from Coder workflow, agent, harness,
  model, permission, memory, verification, and plan context
- trigger or attach to an OpenHands conversation
- poll or stream OpenHands events until a terminal status or timeout
- store raw OpenHands payloads as blob refs
- publish normalized public Coder events for the Start Work timeline
- produce an evidence-backed final report

Planner Chat does not currently run through OpenHands. The decision and future
adapter boundary are recorded in `docs/OPENHANDS_PLANNER_REUSE_DECISION.md`.

## Settings UI

Normal users configure OpenHands from Settings under
`Execution Backend / OpenHands`. Editing `examples/coder.yaml` is only a
developer/headless fallback.

The server exposes:

```text
GET  /api/v3/openhands/settings
POST /api/v3/openhands/settings
GET  /api/v3/openhands/status
```

Settings include:

- `enabled`
- `server_url`, defaulting to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- masked `session_api_key`
- `workspace_mode`, currently `local` or `ephemeral`
- `allow_native_fallback`, defaulting to `false`

The session key is stored only in the Rust server's in-memory settings or read
from `OPENHANDS_SESSION_API_KEY` as a headless fallback. Settings responses
return only whether a key is configured and its source; they do not return the
plaintext key.

The Test OpenHands action performs a direct `GET /health` request with proxy
bypass, so local OpenHands agent servers are not accidentally routed through a
system proxy.

When an `openhands` executor harness runs, Coder emits a public
`backend.selected` event before execution. If OpenHands is not reachable, Coder
emits `backend.blocked`. Native Rust fallback is only used when
`allow_native_fallback` is explicitly enabled; otherwise the run remains
blocked and the timeline shows `Executor backend: blocked - OpenHands not
reachable`.

## Raw Events

Raw OpenHands event payloads are persisted through `RunStore` large-text blob
refs. Public events carry `raw_ref` and an `openhands.raw_event` ref, but the
ordinary timeline does not include the raw JSON payload by default.

This keeps secret-like OpenHands fields and backend-specific event shapes out of
the normal chat and timeline UI while still preserving replay/debug evidence.

## Public ReAct Events

`OpenHandsHarnessBackend` maps raw events into the same public executor event
contract used by the native fallback:

- `executor.reasoning_summary`
- `executor.action_selected`
- `tool.started`
- `tool.completed`
- `observation.recorded`
- `executor.next_step`
- `executor.completed`
- `executor.blocked`
- `executor.failed`

Each public event includes workflow, node, agent, harness, backend, step, and
summary/status fields. The RunStore event envelope remains the source of the
canonical event timestamp.

## Timeline Projection

OpenHands command-shaped events also emit command timeline events:

- `command.previewed` for selected shell or terminal actions before result data
- `command.completed` for command observations with successful result data
- `command.failed` for non-zero, failed, timeout, or error statuses

OpenHands file or patch-shaped events emit `patch.applied` with a sanitized
`files` list. The server timeline projector turns these into public
`command_execution` and `file_change` items.

Backend selection events are projected as public `executor_step` items:

- `Executor backend: OpenHands`
- `Executor backend: native fallback`
- `Executor backend: blocked - OpenHands not reachable`

## Test Boundary

Normal CI uses fake OpenHands event shapes and does not require a live
OpenHands server. Live compatibility checks should remain opt-in because they
need external services and credentials.

## Optional Live Smoke

Use `scripts/live-openhands-smoke.ps1` only when a real OpenHands server is
available. The script is gated by `OPENHANDS_LIVE_SMOKE=1`; without that flag it
can report `skipped` and will not contact OpenHands.

```powershell
$env:OPENHANDS_LIVE_SMOKE="1"
$env:OPENHANDS_AGENT_SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
$env:OPENHANDS_SESSION_API_KEY="..."
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\live-openhands-smoke.ps1
```

The smoke creates a temporary git repository under `.tmp/`, runs a
documentation-only task through the configured `openhands` harness, and checks:

- OpenHands server health
- `backend.selected` recorded with `backend=openhands`
- `docs/OPENHANDS_LIVE_SMOKE_RESULT.md` updated in the temporary repo
- timeline API includes `Executor backend: OpenHands`
- public ReAct timeline events such as executor, tool, command, or patch events
- raw OpenHands event refs in the run store
- final report preview and summary
- Review Changes includes the OpenHands result-doc change
- Undo succeeds or safely reports a supported conflict/unsupported state for that
  change
- no configured API key appears in events, reports, timeline, or changes output

The live smoke must finish with `Status: completed` and a `run.completed` event.
Editing the result document is not enough if the final report is `blocked` or
`failed`.

The current live smoke intentionally requires a documentation-only file edit so
Review Changes and Undo are exercised. CI must keep using fake adapter tests and
must not require this live smoke.

## Local Live Compatibility Record

Latest validated local run:

```text
timestamp: 2026-07-01 20:47:45 +08:00
base_commit_before_record: 27ab5509
OpenHands Agent Server: http://127.0.0.1:8000
provider: DeepSeek via OpenAI-compatible API
model: deepseek-v4-flash
run_id: 2718536d-950b-4415-970d-20f50844ecf2
result: status ok, final report completed, run.completed recorded
timeline: 77 items, 64 public ReAct items
review/undo: 1 Review Changes entry, undo_status undone
secrets_check: passed
```

Compatibility details from that run:

- Coder sends `workspace.kind=LocalWorkspace` and the local repo `working_dir`
  in the conversation payload.
- Coder sends Agent Canvas `kind=Agent` with `terminal`, `file_editor`, and
  `task_tracker` tool names.
- OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek settings are passed to OpenHands through the agent
  `llm` payload from environment variables. API keys are not written to Coder
  metadata or docs.
- OpenHands `finish` tool events are normalized to `executor.completed`.
- The smoke workflow is single-round so an executor completion ends the run.
- The smoke uses `max_events: 100`; this avoids a local OpenHands
  `/events/search?limit=200` HTTP 500 observed during validation.
