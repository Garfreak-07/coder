# Retrieval Policy

Coder treats current repository facts and knowledge hints as different classes
of context.

## Core Rule

```text
RAG is a hint, not evidence.
Repo search/read/test/diff output is evidence.
```

Use native repository evidence for current code facts:

- file discovery
- text search
- bounded file reads with line ranges
- test or command output
- diffs

Use RAG and memory for knowledge hints:

- external docs
- project notes
- design decisions
- roadmaps
- prior run summaries
- user-maintained notes

Rust v3 exposes three retrieval backends through
`POST /api/v3/knowledge/retrieve`:

- `lexical`: always available and the default when no backend is selected.
- `dense_mock`: deterministic local hash-vector retrieval for CI-safe dense
  retrieval coverage.
- `hybrid`: score-fuses lexical and deterministic dense results while applying
  the same ACL and sensitivity filters.

Dense retrieval is config-selected per request. It does not call live embedding
providers in normal CI.

If a RAG result mentions code, verify the claim with repo search/read before
relying on it.

## Evidence Classes

`repo_evidence` can support claims about current code.

`run_evidence` can support claims about commands, tests, runtime facts, logs,
or diffs produced by the current run.

`knowledge_hint` can guide planning and exploration, but it cannot prove the
current code state by itself.

Repo evidence overrides RAG, memory, and Obsidian notes when they disagree.

## Agentic Routing

`AgenticContextRouter` selects context with a deterministic state machine:

```text
classify -> route -> retrieve -> grade -> rewrite -> switch -> verify -> assemble
```

Planning Chat may start with RAG for planning, history, external docs, roadmap
or decision questions. Workflow Supervisor starts with run evidence. Task
Execution starts with native repo evidence and never starts RAG-first.

Code-like knowledge hints set `requires_repo_verification=true`. They can tell
an agent where to look, but they do not support current-code claims until repo
search/read, test output, logs, or diffs verify them.

## Obsidian

Obsidian vaults are future user-managed knowledge sources. They can be useful
for architecture notes, roadmaps, decisions, and personal project notes, but
they are not code evidence. Full Obsidian sync belongs to a future Batch G.

## MCP

MCP is a future adapter layer, not the retrieval core. Future MCP tools should
call Coder retrieval services such as `AgenticContextRouter` and
`NativeRepoContextService`; they must not expose raw Chroma or BM25 endpoints
or bypass Coder ACLs. MCP adapter work belongs to a future Batch H.
