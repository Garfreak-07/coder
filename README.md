# Coder

Planner-led local agent workflow workbench for controlled coding tasks.

Coder is built around an AgentGraph runtime where Planner owns global decisions,
Code Worker performs bounded implementation work, Tester returns evidence, and
the runtime passes compact structured artifacts instead of transcripts.

The current architecture target is v0.9.6 capability-enforced runtime effects:

```text
Ordinary Agent workflow UI
-> AgentRecipe / RuntimeProfileCompiler
-> RuntimeProfileCache
-> RunController / RunGuard
-> AgentGraphRunner / AgentGraphScheduler / WaveExecutor
-> ActionGateway
-> ToolCapability-enforced plugin / MCP / repo intelligence action boundary
-> BudgetBroker round preflight + reservations
-> ContextService
-> AgentRun
-> PlannerStrategy
-> AgentEngineRegistry
-> PlannerEngine / CodeWorkerEngine / TesterEngine / FinalReviewEngine / SynthesizerEngine
-> patch_preview / sandbox_apply / check_result / runtime_action / DebugFinding refs
-> TraceSpan, partitioned stores, structured artifacts, PlannerDecision
```

Only Planner can ask the user. Non-Planner Agents return artifacts, blockers, or
evidence to Planner.

## Runtime Boundary

Product Agent workflow runs use:

```text
AgentWorkflowSpec
-> PlannerOrder.plan_graph
-> RunController / RunGuard
-> BudgetBroker round preflight
-> GraphRunCache
-> ActionGateway
-> AgentTaskEnvelope
-> ContextService
-> BudgetBroker reservations
-> AgentRun
-> AgentEngine
-> execution_result / test_result
-> PlannerInputBundle
-> PlannerDecision
-> RunController next-round decision
```

`WorkflowSpec` and `WorkflowRunner` are legacy compatibility paths for old saved
workflows and advanced preview only. Do not add new product behavior there.
Legacy live-run and compile-preview endpoints are explicitly marked deprecated
or `runtime_type=legacy_preview`; normal product execution uses AgentGraph.

## Core Artifacts

Default AgentGraph artifacts:

- `run_contract`
- `planner_order`
- `execution_result`
- `test_result`
- `planner_decision`
- `round_summary`

Coding diagnostics:

- `repo_index`
- `command_discovery`
- `risk_map`
- `symbol_index`
- `coding_context_packet`
- `patch_preview`
- `check_result`
- `debug_finding`
- `coding_evaluation_report`

Legacy artifacts `plan_artifact`, `patch_artifact`, and `review_artifact` are
retained only for old `WorkflowSpec` flows.

## Key Services

- `ContextService` builds `ContextPacketV2`, selects skill context, prepares
  coding context packets, and writes token ledger entries.
- `RunController` owns PlannerDecision loop control, max rounds, and repeated
  plan fingerprint guards. It also maps round budget preflight denials into
  blocked run decisions and writes run diagnostics.
- `BudgetBroker` can dry-run an upcoming round budget before scheduling worker
  waves, then reserves model, tool, and context budgets before execution.
  Preflight, reservation, and usage diagnostics are written to run results.
- `ActionGateway` is the runtime entry point for context construction, patch
  preview, sandbox patch apply, sandbox command checks, plugin, MCP, repo
  intelligence, and artifact repair/validation actions. Declared `ActionSpec`
  types must either be implemented by `ActionGateway` or absent from
  `ACTION_TYPES`. Plugin and MCP actions merge caller risk with registry
  `ToolCapability`; approval-gated or unknown operations are blocked before
  execution unless explicitly approved.
- `RuntimeProfileCompiler` converts ordinary Agent roles into internal engine,
  context, token, artifact, plugin, skill, memory, repair, and tool policies.
  Research and draft Agent roles use the knowledge-worker `SynthesizerEngine`
  fallback until dedicated ResearchWorkerEngine and DraftWorkerEngine packages
  are installed.
- `RuntimeProfileCache` avoids recompiling identical workflow/extension/profile
  combinations.
- `AgentRun` dispatches PlannerOrder, Worker, Tester, FinalReview, Synthesizer,
  and PlannerDecision work through `AgentEngineRegistry`.
- `PlannerStrategy` provides backend-only local planning modes: `full` uses
  `PlannerEngine`, `simple` and `single_worker` synthesize valid local
  Planner artifacts, and `replay` consumes supplied Planner artifacts.
- `AgentGraphExecutor` is a legacy compatibility adapter and is not constructed
  by the product `AgentGraphRunner`.
- `PatchService` owns proposed change validation, risk path blocking, patch
  preview, apply, and rollback behind `ActionGateway`.
- `CommandService` owns scoped cwd validation, argv-based checks, shell command
  policy, command approval, timeouts, and output capture behind
  `ActionGateway`. Shell commands remain supported for compatibility but
  require approval outside sandboxed execution.
- Model-output validation and repair enter through `ActionGateway` actions;
  the repair service remains behind that gateway boundary.
- `ExtensionRouter` routes globally installed plugins and skills per work item.
- `TraceContext` attaches `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `parent_span_id` to run
  events.
- `PartitionedRunStores` provides the metadata, result, event, artifact, blob,
  ledger, context, tool-result, live-run, extension, and cache write path over
  the `.coder` layout.

## Install

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Garfreak-07/Coder.git
cd Coder
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run Locally

Start the API:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\coder-api.exe --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8876
```

Start the frontend dev server:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

Vite proxies `/api/*` to `http://127.0.0.1:8876`.

If `frontend/dist` exists, the API can serve the built frontend from:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8876
```

## CLI Example

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\coder.exe --repo . `
  --workflow examples\workflows\coding-workbench.json `
  --request "Build the smallest Planner-led loop"
```

Use `--approve` only for workflows that include explicit human gates or local
effects that should be preapproved.

## API Surface

Common development endpoints:

- `GET /api/v2/health`
- `GET /api/v2/agent-role-cards`
- `POST /api/v2/agent-workflows/validate`
- `POST /api/v2/agent-workflows/runtime-profiles`
- `POST /api/v2/live-agent-runs`
- `GET /api/v2/live-agent-runs/{run_id}`
- `GET /api/v2/live-agent-runs/{run_id}/events`
- `POST /api/v2/live-agent-runs/{run_id}/planner-response`
- `GET /api/v2/extensions/plugins`
- `GET /api/v2/extensions/skills`
- `GET /api/v2/extensions/search`

Legacy `/api/v2/skills/*`, `/api/v2/live-runs`, and `WorkflowSpec` endpoints
remain for compatibility and are marked deprecated where they overlap the
AgentGraph product path. `/api/v2/live-runs/{run_id}` returns `410 Gone` for
AgentGraph run ids with `/api/v2/live-agent-runs/{run_id}` migration URLs. New
Agent product behavior should use the AgentGraph and Extensions endpoints.

`compile_agent_workflow_legacy_preview()` is the explicit compatibility
compiler for advanced preview and migration/debug only. `compile_agent_workflow()`
remains a compatibility alias.

## Testing

Backend:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall src tests
```

Frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd run build
```

Focused architecture boundary tests:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_architecture_boundaries
```

## Development Rules

- Keep the ordinary product path Agent-first.
- User interaction must remain `User <-> Planner` only.
- Worker, Tester, and Final Tester must not ask the user directly.
- Product live Agent workflows must not compile into legacy `WorkflowSpec`.
- New context, patch, command, repair, and validation behavior should enter
  through `ActionGateway`; services such as `ContextService`, `PatchService`,
  and `CommandService` stay behind that boundary.
- Budget-affecting work should run `BudgetBroker` round preflight before
  scheduler creation, then reserve through `BudgetBroker` before execution.
- Local planner modes must still produce `planner_order`, `planner_input_bundle`,
  and `planner_decision` artifacts through the normal AgentGraph control plane;
  ordinary UI must not expose planner strategy knobs.
- New model-output validation and repair behavior should go through
  `ActionGateway` `validate_artifact` and `repair_artifact` actions.
- New Planner, Tester, FinalReview, Synthesizer, Worker, and PlannerDecision
  execution behavior should enter through `AgentRun` and
  `AgentEngineRegistry`; keep `AgentGraphExecutor` as a compatibility adapter
  only.
- Coding auto-loop behavior should preserve the path:
  `proposed_changes -> patch_preview -> sandbox_apply/check_result -> DebugFinding -> PlannerDecision`,
  with structured artifact refs carried in `PlannerInputBundle.effects`.
- Worker artifacts may request low-level runtime actions through
  `requested_actions`; plugin, MCP, and repo-index outputs are recorded as
  `runtime_action` effects with `tool_result_ref` / `output_ref`.
- Extensions are globally installed and routed per work item.
- Ordinary UI should not expose runtime JSON, harness graphs, context policies,
  token budgets, or manual capability checklists.

## Secrets

Do not commit API keys or local secrets. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local
model configuration. `.env` is ignored by Git.

Provider configuration is OpenAI-compatible and optional. Without credentials,
the runtime uses mock mode for safe local development.
