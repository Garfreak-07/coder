# Coder

Planner-led local agent workflow workbench for controlled coding tasks.

Coder runs a local workflow where a strong Planner owns the global decision,
Executor performs authorized implementation work, and Tester returns evidence.
Agents exchange compact structured artifacts instead of full transcripts.

## Current Product Target

The active direction is:

```text
v0.9 Ordinary-First Unified Agent Architecture
+ Planner-led coding loop
+ AgentRecipe role cards compiled into RuntimeProfiles
+ AgentRun / AgentEngine execution for coding work
+ Extension System with Plugins and Skills
+ ContextService, TokenLedger, PatchService, CommandService, and ArtifactRepairService
```

The default user-facing template is:

```text
Planner Agent -> Code Worker Agent -> Tester Agent -> Planner Agent
      ^                                             |
      +----------- automatic replan / finish --------+
```

The product runtime also supports AgentGraph execution where Planner can split a
round into multiple work items, assign them to reachable downstream Agents, wait
on `depends_on`, and submit an ordered compact `PlannerInputBundle` back to
Planner.

Only Planner can ask the human or decide whether to continue, finish, stop, or
request confirmation. Worker, Tester, and Final Reviewer return structured
facts, evidence, or blockers to Planner. Runtime internals such as repository
indexing, context selection, artifact storage, loop routing, path guards, patch
safety, sandbox checks, approvals, and replay stay behind that agent-only
surface.

The v0.4 AgentWorkflow builder remains the user-facing workflow surface.
v0.8 strengthens the coding runtime underneath it: Coder first builds repo
intelligence, Planner creates reachable concrete work items, Code Worker emits
`proposed_changes`, runtime creates patch previews, Tester returns evidence,
debug findings are fed back to Planner, and coding diagnostics report whether
the loop actually improved the task.

## Core Artifacts

The default workflow uses six validated planning artifacts:

- `run_contract`
- `planner_order`
- `execution_result`
- `test_result`
- `planner_decision`
- `round_summary`

The v0.9 coding kernel also produces internal coding artifacts:

- `repo_index`
- `command_discovery`
- `risk_map`
- `symbol_index`
- `coding_context_packet`
- `patch_preview`
- `check_result`
- `debug_finding`
- `coding_evaluation_report`

Legacy `plan_artifact`, `patch_artifact`, and `review_artifact` are retained
only for old saved workflows.

## AgentGraph Plan Semantics

AgentGraph `PlannerOrder.plan_graph.work_items` separates execution dependencies
from result presentation:

1. Planner may emit work items in any list order.
2. `depends_on` is the only semantic execution dependency.
3. Work items with empty `depends_on` are ready together by default.
4. `merge_index` controls stable result presentation back to Planner.
5. `merge_index` does not make earlier work items block later independent work.
6. Resource limits such as `max_concurrency` may limit dispatch, but do not
   create dependency meaning.
7. `PlannerInputBundle` and `round_summary.ordered_state` are sorted by
   `merge_index`.

Execution order is derived from dependency readiness, not from Planner list
order or `merge_index`.

## Runtime Boundary

Product runs use the AgentGraph runtime:

```text
AgentWorkflowSpec -> PlannerOrder.plan_graph -> GraphRunCache -> AgentTaskEnvelope
-> Execution/Test caches -> PlannerInputBundle -> PlannerDecision
```

Legacy `WorkflowSpec` / `WorkflowRunner` remain for advanced inspection and old
saved workflows only. New product behavior should not be added to the legacy
runner.

## Current Capabilities

- `AgentWorkflowSpec` for the user-visible Planner / Executor / Tester layer.
- Ordinary Agent creation can use role cards and omit manual capability
  selection; runtime derives compatible capabilities and profiles.
- `AgentRecipe` and `RuntimeProfileCompiler` compile ordinary Agent choices into
  internal engine, context, token, artifact, plugin, skill, memory, repair, and
  tool policies.
- `AgentRun` dispatches code work through `AgentEngineRegistry` and
  `CodeWorkerEngine`.
- Extensions page separates Plugins, Skills, Installed, and Updates.
- `AgentHarness` base loop with Planner, Code Worker, Tester, and Final Review
  policies.
- Repository intelligence for Python packages, Vite/React frontends, risk
  paths, check commands, and regex-backed symbol navigation.
- Coding context packet selection that includes relevant files and snippets
  without loading the full repository.
- v0.4 Agent workflow validation with one primary Planner, arbitrary Agent
  count, hidden handoff inference, and deterministic save-blocking errors.
- Initial capability registry for Planner, Executor/Worker, and Tester/Reviewer
  capabilities.
- `AgentGraphRuntime` powers product `/api/v2/live-agent-runs` executions
  without compiling Agent workflows into legacy `WorkflowSpec`.
- Legacy `WorkflowSpec` compilation remains available only for advanced runtime
  preview and old saved workflows.
- FastAPI runtime API and React + TypeScript workbench.
- Mock-mode executor for local development without model credentials.
- Structured artifact validation, event emission, storage, and replay.
- Context packet events before agent calls.
- Provider settings for OpenAI-compatible model providers.
- Local run history, stored run replay, and artifact/blob loading.
- Scoped path guards, patch preview/apply/rollback primitives, command
  approvals, and preflight checks retained behind `PatchService` and
  `CommandService`.
- DebugFinding artifacts and `coding_eval` diagnostics for Planner replan and
  benchmark reporting.

## Install

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Garfreak-07/Coder.git
cd Coder
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

Frontend dependencies are in `frontend/`:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run the API

```powershell
coder-api --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8876
```

If `frontend/dist` exists, the API serves it from:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8876
```

## Run the Frontend in Development

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

Vite proxies `/api/*` to the API on port `8876`.

## Run the Default Workflow from the CLI

```powershell
coder --repo . `
  --workflow examples\workflows\coding-workbench.json `
  --request "Build the smallest Planner-led loop"
```

Use `--approve` only for workflows that include explicit human gates.

## Coding Harness Diagnostics

AgentGraph runs now include repository intelligence and coding diagnostics in
their run data:

```text
repo_intelligence.repo_index
repo_intelligence.command_discovery
repo_intelligence.risk_map
repo_intelligence.symbol_index
graph_run_cache.context_packets_v2
debug_findings
coding_eval
```

The first benchmark fixture is in:

```text
tests/fixtures/coding_tasks/python_bugfix_001.json
```

Run backend validation with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall src tests
```

## API Keys and Local Secrets

Do not commit API keys or local secrets. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local
model configuration. `.env` is ignored by Git.

Supported provider configuration is OpenAI-compatible and remains optional.
When credentials are missing, the runtime uses mock mode for safe local testing.
