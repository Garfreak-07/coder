# Coder

Planner-led local AgentGraph workbench for controlled coding tasks.

Coder keeps the ordinary product path small:

```text
User request
-> Planning Chat draft
-> user confirmation
-> AgentGraphRunner / RunController
-> SharedRunState
-> Context packets and RoundWorkingSet
-> HarnessRuntimeManager
-> Conversation Harness / Task Execution Harness
-> OpenHandsRuntimeProvider or InternalFallbackProvider
-> NativeRuntimeStore / BlobStore
-> ArtifactProjector
-> final_report
```

The Planner owns global decisions and communicates ordinary user-facing
outcomes through the `final_report` artifact. Executors perform bounded
implementation work, run allowed checks, and return structured verification
evidence. The runtime passes structured artifacts and refs instead of
transcript-sized context.

## OpenHands Runtime Refactor

Coder is moving toward this runtime split:

```text
Coder = Agent OS / workflow orchestrator
OpenHands SDK = default agent runtime provider when enabled
```

Coder owns the product flow, Planner authority, AgentGraph loop,
RunController, context and memory planes, skill routing, safety policy,
sandbox policy, artifact validation, runtime event storage, observability, and
final reports. OpenHands owns the model/tool interaction loop and native
workspace events when `CODER_ENABLE_OPENHANDS_RUNTIME=1` and the SDK is
available. Without that flag or SDK, Coder uses the internal fallback provider
so local development and tests remain runnable.

OpenHands SDK runtime verification uses Python 3.12 or newer. The local
integration has been import-verified with `openhands-sdk` and `openhands-tools`
1.29.2, but those packages remain optional until the adapter is fully wired and
validated.

The ordinary Planner Chat path is explicit:

```text
User request
-> ProjectPlanDraft / RunContractDraft
-> user confirms or discards
-> live AgentGraph run starts only after confirmation
```

Planning Chat Mode cannot modify files or run commands. In-run Workflow
Supervisor Mode produces planner orders, planner decisions, and final reports.
Task Execution Harnesses perform bounded execution work and cannot talk to the
user, commit, push, deploy, or write long-term memory directly.

## Runtime Hardening

The AgentGraph runtime now includes a hardened execution layer while preserving
the Planner -> Execution Engine -> Planner authority model:

- `ActionGateway` can route low-level tool effects through an internal
  `ToolExecutionService` with ordered results, conservative concurrency,
  per-action timeout handling, structured execution events, and large result
  budgeting.
- Context construction supports artifact-aware projection and compaction.
  Oversized snippets, artifacts, and tool outputs are represented as previews
  plus `sha256:<digest>` BlobStore refs.
- The executor harness supports bounded self-checks, verification checks, and
  multi-stage artifact repair. Invalid model output becomes a Planner-visible
  blocked artifact instead of an unstructured runtime crash.
- The CodeWorker harness can optionally run a provider-neutral internal
  action/observation loop. When `CODER_ENABLE_CODE_WORKER_TOOL_LOOP=1`, model
  steps must return `harness_action`, `harness_action_batch`, or a final
  `execution_result`; runtime validates actions through `ToolGate`, executes
  supported effects through `ActionGateway`, budgets large outputs into
  preview/ref form, records action lifecycle, and enriches the final artifact
  from runtime facts instead of model claims.
- CodeWorker finalization now uses a stop gate and bounded recovery policy:
  failed command or patch evidence cannot be ignored, model-provided changed
  files and patch refs are checked against runtime session facts, read/search
  actions can batch, patch/command actions remain exclusive, and future
  streaming execution has a provider-neutral internal executor.
- `WaveExecutor` records per-work-item attempts, timeout/cancel evidence,
  conservative retry diagnostics, completed/blocked outcomes, and wave-level
  summaries.
- Consecutive blocked rounds are promoted to a blocked run result so the Planner
  does not loop indefinitely on the same unresolved execution blocker.
- Planner decisions are normalized to `continue` or `finish`. Blocked, failed,
  and cancelled finishes produce a structured `final_report` artifact instead
  of relying on ad hoc status text.
- `SharedRunState` records compact control, planner, work-item, artifact,
  message, memory, and final-report refs. Planner, Executor, final-report, and
  debug views are projected from that shared state instead of exposing raw
  runtime caches by default.
- Canonical harness contracts and the runtime capability resolver define the
  tool, memory, skill, and denied-capability surface for the Conversation
  Harness and Task Execution Harness, while legacy harness IDs remain supported
  during migration.
- `HarnessRuntimeManager` is the central runtime entrypoint. It applies safety
  and sandbox policy before selecting `OpenHandsRuntimeProvider` or
  `InternalFallbackProvider`.
- Live AgentGraph runs expose pause, resume, cancel, and heartbeat control for
  long/background execution.

## Long Context, Storage, And Recovery

Coder uses one durable path for large text:

- `BlobStore` stores full large strings by `sha256:<digest>` id.
- Context packets live in `ContextPacketStore`; tool results live in
  `ToolResultStore`.
- Events store summary, id/ref, status, and size, not full packets or large
  tool output.
- Normal AgentGraph events are ref-only for context packets, coding packets,
  token ledger entries, task envelopes, and tool outputs. Full payloads live in
  run partitions and are loaded only through explicit artifact, context-packet,
  tool-result, or blob endpoints.
- `ContextService` remains the public context construction entrypoint. Its
  private projection chooses hot/warm/cold context before `ContextCompactor`
  shrinks selected fields.
- `RunResult.resume_checkpoint` is the active recovery path for interrupted
  AgentGraph runs. Reloaded queued/running live runs with checkpoint data are
  marked `blocked` with `status_code="resume_available"`.
- `run_group_id`, `parent_run_id`, `continued_from_run_id`, and `turn_index`
  provide lightweight multi-run continuity without a parallel session store.

See [docs/runtime-storage.md](docs/runtime-storage.md) and
[docs/long-context.md](docs/long-context.md) for storage contributor notes.
See [docs/codeworker_harness_tool_loop.md](docs/codeworker_harness_tool_loop.md)
for CodeWorker tool-loop architecture, action policy, recovery, lifecycle, and
test commands.

Most low-level runtime behavior is feature-flagged during rollout:

```powershell
CODER_ENABLE_TOOL_EXECUTION_SERVICE=1
CODER_ENABLE_CONTEXT_COMPACTION=1
CODER_ENABLE_HARNESS_SELF_CHECK=1
CODER_ENABLE_CODE_WORKER_TOOL_LOOP=1
CODER_ENABLE_WAVE_RETRY=1
CODER_ENABLE_OPENHANDS_RUNTIME=1
```

## Current Product Surface

The app uses a ChatGPT-style left sidebar and keeps chat separate from workflow
editing:

- `Planner Chat`: draft a plan, scope, success criteria, and risks before a run
  starts; confirm the draft to execute, then inspect the structured final
  report, run status, evidence, patches, checks, and explicit debug exports.
- `Agent Workflow`: load saved Agent workflows, load the default workflow, edit
  the basic Planner -> Executor loop, save, save as a new copy, import, and
  export.
- `Extensions`: manage installed plugins and skills.
- `Settings`: configure the local model provider.

The ordinary product UI does not expose runtime JSON editors, workflow IDs,
agent inspectors, manual edge labels, engine settings, harness controls, or
legacy runtime previews. Stored run inspection and raw event data remain
available only through explicit debug/export affordances and API endpoints, not
as the default Planner Chat journey.

Normal Planner decisions are `continue` or `finish`; legacy `ask_human`,
`planner_human_prompt`, and planner-response resume flows are not part of the
ordinary product path. If the run cannot safely proceed, it finishes with a
blocked `final_report`.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\coder-api.exe --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8876
```

Start the frontend dev server:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

Vite proxies `/api/*` to `http://127.0.0.1:8876`.

If `frontend/dist` exists, the API can serve the built frontend from:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8876
```

## CLI Example

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\coder.exe --repo . `
  --agent-workflow examples\workflows\coding-workbench.json `
  --request "Inspect this project and propose the next safe step"
```

Use `--approve` only when you intentionally want to preapprove local effects for
a trusted run.

## Development Rules

- Keep the ordinary product path Planner-led and AgentGraph-only.
- User interaction must remain `User <-> Planner`.
- Executors must not ask the user directly.
- Executor results must include `execution_result.verification` with pass,
  skipped, failed, or blocked evidence for the Planner to judge.
- Planner Chat drafts must be confirmed before a live AgentGraph run starts.
- Conversation Harness profiles cannot write files, run commands, commit, push,
  deploy, or publish externally.
- Task Execution Harness profiles cannot ask the user, commit, push, deploy,
  publish externally, or write long-term memory directly.
- Product live Agent workflows must run through AgentGraph.
- New context, patch, command, repair, validation, plugin, and MCP behavior
  should enter through `ActionGateway`.
- CodeWorker tool-loop actions must remain scoped to `read_file`,
  `search_files`, `inspect_git_diff`, `propose_patch`, `apply_patch_sandbox`,
  `run_command_sandbox`, `read_tool_output`, and `return_execution_result`.
  Executors must not use `run_command`, publish externally, install plugins, or
  enable MCP servers from inside the harness.
- Executors cannot write long-term memory directly. Durable memory writes must
  go through `MemoryService` as evidence-backed, staged/gated deltas.
- New tools, MCP manifests, and skills should be represented in the runtime
  capability registries before they are exposed to a harness. MCP manifests are
  parsed and validated locally and are never enabled by default.
- Budget-affecting work should use `BudgetBroker` preflight and reservations.
- Large text should be persisted through `BlobStore`; do not add another durable
  context or tool-result ref format.
- The ordinary UI should not expose runtime JSON, engine knobs, harness graphs,
  context policies, token budgets, manual capability checklists, or advanced
  edge editing.

## Secrets

Do not commit API keys or local secrets. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local
model configuration. `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.local-env.ps1` are ignored by
Git.

Provider configuration is OpenAI-compatible and optional. Without credentials,
the runtime uses mock mode for safe local development.

For OpenHands runtime smoke tests, prefer local environment variables rather
than committed files:

```powershell
$env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="..."
$env:LLM_API_KEY=$env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
$env:LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.deepseek.com"
$env:LLM_MODEL="deepseek-v4-flash"
$env:CODER_ENABLE_OPENHANDS_RUNTIME="1"
```
